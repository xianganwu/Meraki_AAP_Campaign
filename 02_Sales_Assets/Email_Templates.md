## Email 1: The "ClickOps" Trap
**Subject:** Is your Meraki "simple" management becoming a manual burden?
**Subject B:** Managing 500 networks shouldn't take 500 clicks.

Hi {{first_name}},

We all love the Meraki Dashboard for its simplicity. But as your network scales to {{company_size}} locations, that simplicity can turn into "ClickOps"—repetitive, manual clicking that eats up your team's time.

Are you finding yourself manually applying the same configuration change 20, 50, or 100 times?

**Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)** changes the game. It allows you to manage your entire Meraki fleet as code:
*   **One-Click Updates:** Push changes to all sites instantly.
*   **Drift Protection:** Ensure no site deviates from your standard.
*   **Zero-Touch Provisioning:** Deploy new branches in minutes, not days.

I'd love to share a short video on how [Customer Name] reduced their config time by 90% using Ansible with Meraki.

Open to a brief chat this Thursday?

Best,

[Your Name]

## Email 2: Security at Scale (The PSK Problem)
**Subject:** When was the last time you rotated your Wi-Fi keys?
**Subject B:** Automating the impossible: Monthly PSK rotation.

Hi {{first_name}},

Be honest: How old is the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) for your "Guest" or "Staff" Wi-Fi?

For most organizations, rotating these keys is a security nightmare. Updating hundreds of Meraki networks manually is just too hard, so it never happens. This leaves your network vulnerable to anyone who has *ever* worked there.

**What if you could rotate keys monthly, automatically?**

With Ansible + Meraki, you can:
1.  Generate random, secure keys.
2.  Push them to every access point instantly.
3.  Email the new key to site managers automatically.

It’s zero-trust security, without the headache.

Can I show you a 5-minute demo of this in action?

Best,

[Your Name]

## Email 3: The Unified Picture (Beyond Meraki)
**Subject:** Meraki is an island. Build a bridge.
**Subject B:** One platform for Meraki, Core, and Cloud.

Hi {{first_name}},

Your network is more than just Meraki. You likely have Core switches, Data Center routers, and maybe some cloud networking too.

The problem? You have a different tool for each one.
*   Meraki = Dashboard
*   Core = CLI
*   Cloud = Console

**Ansible Automation Platform** is the glue that connects them all.

Imagine a single workflow that:
1.  Creates a VLAN on your Core Switch (Cisco IOS-XE).
2.  Updates the routing rules in the Data Center.
3.  Configures the SSID at the Branch (Meraki).

Stop swiveling between chairs. Orchestrate the entire flow.

Are you free next Tuesday afternoon to discuss your broader automation strategy?

Best,

[Your Name]

## Email 4: The Break-up / Nurture
**Subject:** Should I close this file?
**Subject B:** Last try: Meraki Automation

Hi {{first_name}},

I haven't heard back, so I assume automated network operations isn't a priority right now. That's completely fine.

I'll stop reaching out, but I wanted to leave you with this **[Link to Red Hat Ansible Network Automation Guide]**. It’s a great resource when you're ready to tackle configuration drift and manual provisioning.

If you ever find yourself clicking the same button for the 100th time in the Meraki dashboard, give me a call.

Best,

[Your Name]
